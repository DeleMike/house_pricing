near bay - $274470.0625
<1h_ocean - $285093.09375
near-ocean - $279814.65625
inland - $162184.6875

I tested for the same values for the four different areas:
age = 18
total_rooms = 3
total_bedrooms  = 1
people_in_area = 20
people_in_house = 2
average_income_of_house_members = $80000 dollars ----per year
longitude = -100
latitude = 21

Seems living hundred miles away from the ocean cost more. Best guess is that it is more safe, nice view and maybe calibre of people staying around here.
